# DriverDNA_app
DRIVES (DRIVEr Services) is an Android application that connects to a vehicle through an OBD-II Bluetooth dongle to collect driving data and generate a Driver DNA profile. Based on the driverâ€™s style (braking, turning, speeding, RPM), the app provides personalized services such as eco-driving rewards, service discounts, and recommendations.
